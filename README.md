## Description

Integrate and visualise oz allergy forecasts in Home Assistant.

## Installation

It's best if you install and manage this custom component via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/). HACS opens up a whole world of options so it's really worth doing if you haven't already.

HACS is also the best way to install and mananage another requirement for this project - The custom [Button card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card)  is the backbone of the Lovelace "card" for this project. Button Card is really cool of itself too so this is really nice to have too anyway. 

1. Install [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)
2. Install [Button card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card) (Using HACS installation method is recommended)
3. Install this custom component using HACS (current uses custom repository method). HACS > Integrations > Top right three dots > Custom Repositories: Repository = https://github.com/OkhammahkO/oz-poll, Category = Integration
